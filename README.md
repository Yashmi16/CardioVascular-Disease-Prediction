# CardioVascular-Disease-Prediction

Applying Descriptive analysis on the dataset that contains data of 70,000 patients. Applied Data Visualization libraries from python such as Matplotlib, sklearn, seaborn analysis.
Implemented various predictive models like Logistic Regression, KNN model, Support Vector Machine, na√Øve base model, decision tree, random forest (Gradient boosting). The accuracy of random forest (Gradient boosting) was higher than the other models.
